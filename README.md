📈 Bitcoin Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project builds a simple machine learning model to predict the next day's Bitcoin closing price using historical daily trading data. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training a linear regression model. The performance is evaluated using common regression metrics and visualized with Matplotlib.

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of daily Bitcoin trading data with the following features:

Open Time: Timestamp of the trading day start

Open: Opening price

High: Highest price of the day

Low: Lowest price of the day

Close: Closing price (used as target)

Volume: Trading volume for the day

🔧 Features Used

The following features were selected for prediction:

Open

High

Low

Volume

Target: Next day's Close price


🚀 Workflow

1. Load & Preprocess the Data
Convert Open Time to datetime

Sort by date

Create Target column by shifting Close one day up

Drop last row with NaN

2. Train-Test Split
Use 80% for training, 20% for testing (no shuffle to maintain time sequence)

3. Train Model
